# [Bit Hacks](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)
* By Sean Eron Anderson [seander@cs.stanford.edu](mailto:seander@cs.stanford.edu)

Sean Anderson's wonderful compilation of [Bit Twiddling Hacks](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html), converted to a more readable [Markdown version](BitHacks.md) and accompanying [PDF](BitHacks.pdf).

For a C implementation of some of the Bit Hacks, see Jeroen de Bruijn's repository [here](https://github.com/vidavidorra/BitOperations).

## Note
This is really meant to be viewed as the Markdown source, so you can easily resize the window and interact with the code. However, a PDF is also included, although currently syntax highlighting is missing until I migrate this to LaTeX.

The PDF was generated using [Markdown to PDF](http://markdowntopdf.com).
